# Homyz Real Estate Project

Welcome to the **Homyz Real Estate Project**! This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) application where users can browse and interact with real estate listings.

## Project Overview

The Homyz Real Estate website is a responsive platform for searching, viewing, and interacting with property listings. It allows users to browse properties, view detailed information about each listing, and get in touch with agents or property owners. This project demonstrates the power of the **MERN stack** combined with **Auth0** for authentication and **Cloudinary** for image management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup using **Auth0**.
- **Property Listings**: Users can view a list of properties with details like price, location, and description.
- **Property Images**: Upload and display property images using **Cloudinary**.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **React Hooks**: Utilized **React hooks** for state management and side effects.
- **Animations**: Added smooth transitions and animations using **Framer Motion**.
- **Backend**: Built with **Express** to handle API requests and interact with **MongoDB**.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - React Router
  - Mantine UI
  - Framer Motion
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Auth0
- **Cloud Storage**: Cloudinary
- **Styling**: Modern CSS

## Installation & Setup

npm run dev
```

## Challenges Faced

-   **Port Conflicts**: At times, the system was running on multiple ports, causing conflicts. This took some time to troubleshoot.
-   **Typo Issues**: A minor typo (`bookingVisit` to `BookingVisit`) caused a full day of debugging, but eventually was resolved.
-   **Learning React Hooks**: Some React concepts, especially hooks, were difficult to grasp initially, but with practice, it got easier.
